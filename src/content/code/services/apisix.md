name: Apache APISIX
description: Apache APISIX is a dynamic, real-time, high-performance API gateway. APISIX provides rich traffic management features such as load balancing, dynamic upstream, canary release, circuit breaking, authentication, observability, and more. As a cloud-native API gateway, Apache APISIX already has the matching ability to recognize GraphQL syntax at the beginning of its design. By efficiently matching GraphQL statements carried in requests, it can filter out abnormal traffic to further ensure security and improve system performance.
